# Starter Web Repo

This repository is for showing how Git and GitHub works.
It was forked from the Author into my own Github account.

## Purpose

Sample website with plenty of files for demos.
This is for Udemy7, Git Complete


## Deployment
You will need some web server, this is a web site.
Most likely it will be a LAMP setup.

You could most likely also use a WAMP setup, but why would you do that?
